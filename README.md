# smallestwebrecursive

## It's impossible to complete this in the allotted time.
 Create a function using JavaScript (NOT jQuery) for which you can pass the name of an item and theCobWeb
 and the function returns the smallest web it was found inside of.
 Your code should work if someone were to modify theCobWeb.  
  for example if you gave your program 
    comb it should give back biggestWeb
    toenails it should give back tinyWeb
    headphones it should give back otherBigWeb
 HINT: you should use recursion
